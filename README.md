# Pn_function_recosntr
Computing Pn functions from image and use them for reconstruction via stochastic optimization.
This code was written and tested by Pei-En Chen.
The current version allows one to select any combination of the full set of Pn functions for n =2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and lineal-path function L.
The current reconstruction codes use brute-force methods to recompute each correlation functions, and can only work on small systems.
